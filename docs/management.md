## The 4 questions

### What went well?
* The successful distribution of all tasks allowed for a good workflow
* Everything that was planned was accomplished on time

### What didn’t go so well?
* Small changes were not attributed to the specific issue branch made for complicated merge to the Main branch
* More things could have been done if it wasn't for the "language barrier" with Flutter

### What have we learned?
* We need to plan out the little changes to the project so that we can simplify the process or merging to the main branch
* We learned a little bit of flutter and improved our development skills
* How to work with Firebase authentication and real-time database

### What still puzzles me?
* The specifics of the main game logic that are ahead
* How to connect all the user data with the database
* Some little quality-of-life tweaks we could add in the future, but we still need to understand how to implement them
